# Supervised & Unsupervised learning | Online News Popularity


## Project requirements

* Clean up your dataset
* Build unsupervised models and compare to pick the best one
* Build supervised models from it and compare to pick to best one

## Dataset

This dataset summarizes a heterogeneous set of features about articles published by Mashable in a period of two years. 
* The articles were published by Mashable (www.mashable.com) and their content as the rights to reproduce it belongs to them. Hence, this dataset does not share the original content but some statistics associated with it. The original content be publicly accessed and retrieved using the provided urls.
* Acquisition date: January 8, 2015
* The estimated relative performance values were estimated by the authors using a Random Forest classifier and a rolling windows as assessment method. See their article for more details on how the relative performance values were set.
* Number of Attributes: 61 (58 predictive attributes, 2 non-predictive, 1 goal field)
