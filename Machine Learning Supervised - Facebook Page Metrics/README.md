# Supervised Machine Learning | Regression | Facebook Page Metrics


## Project requirements

* Clean up your dataset
* Describe your data with descriptive stats (mean, median, whatsoever...)
* Do some visualization
* Build regression models and compare them to choose the best one

## Dataset

The data is related to posts published during the year of 2014 on the Facebook's page of a renowned cosmetics brand.
This dataset contains 500 of the 790 rows and part of the features analyzed by Moro et al. (2016). The remaining were omitted due to confidentiality issues.
It includes 7 features known prior to post publication and 12 features for evaluating post impact

## Deliverables

* **A (.ipynb) file** -``supervised-learning_regression.ipynb``that contains the code used for data cleaning, descriptive statistics, data visualization and regression models
* **A folder** -``Facebook_metrics``that contains the dataset
* **A ``README.md`` file** containing a detailed explanation on the project requirements
