# Python Project | Tic Tac Toe | Build your own game !


## Project Description
In this project, we had to create our first software!
We were tasked with creating a **game** that interacts with the user, using the functions and basic python resources we have recently learned. This game will be able to take an input from the user and provide an output. 

## Games
We had develop one of the following games:

* Strong Random Password Generator
* Guess The Number
* Hangman
* Message Encryption & Decryption
* Mastermind
* Tic Tac Toe
* Blackjack
* Soldier & Dice (Risk)

**I had to build Tic Tac Toe!**

## Project Goals

* Fork and manage your own git repository. 
* Build your own code from scratch. 
* Put into practice the basic python concepts learned.


## Deliverables

The following deliverables should be pushed to your Github repo for this chapter.

* **A (.py) file** -``final_final_version.py``that contains the code used to develop the Tic Tac Toe Game
* **A ``README.md`` file** containing a detailed explanation of the project requirements
